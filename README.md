A project I'm using to learn React.js by expanding on the things I learned from Level Up Tutorials React for Beginners.

Goals:
To gain a more complete understanding of component construction, api calls, and utilizing state and props.
Practice with React router, prop-types, and styled-components.
Keep with accessibilty practices.
